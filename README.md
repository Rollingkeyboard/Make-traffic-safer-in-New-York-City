# Make-traffic-safer-in-New-York-City

2021 Fall CS-GY 6513 A Big Data Final Project At NYU Tandon


## Introduction
New York City is an international metropolis with great influence on the global economy, commerce, finance, media, politics, education, and entertainment. With over 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23,582,649 in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York is one of the world's most populous megacities[1]. According to U.S. News and World Report, NYC ranks 4th for the worst traffic in the nation[2]. Since the heavily congested roads in a densely populated area result in a lot of traffic accidents. Our project is to use big data techniques to analyze the collisions in the five boroughs of NYC and then figure out any applicable method that could reduce the incidence of car accidents.
